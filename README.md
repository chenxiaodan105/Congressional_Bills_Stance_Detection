## Introduction

**Stance detection** is the extraction of a peopleâ€™s reaction to a claim made by a primary actor. It is a core part of a set of approaches to capture political trends. Companies are sensitive to political policies. It could bring them a lot of benefits, such as the fund, the support from the government, if they could catch up with political trends beforehand.

In this project, NLP method is used to do the prediction based on 2 sessions of congressional bills and transcripts.Just explore it and have fun !
